# Full-Stack E-Commerce App

This is a full-stack e-commerce application I built from scratch as part of my learning journey to master modern web development. The goal of this project was to deeply understand how all layers of a modern web app fit together from the frontend interface to backend logic, data management, and deployment.

## Project Objectives

- Build a feature-rich e-commerce application using **React** and **Next.js**
- Learn how to implement AI-powered search with **Algolia**
- Design accessible and visually appealing interfaces using **shadcn/ui**
- Add smooth, user-friendly animations with **Framer Motion**
- Handle image uploads and retrieval efficiently using **Uploadthing**
- Set up a scalable backend using **PostgreSQL** and **Drizzle ORM**
- Build intuitive and reliable forms with **React Hook Form**
- Manage both client and server state using **Zustand** and **React Query**
- Utilize serverless functions for backend logic and scalability
- Integrate **Stripe** for secure and reliable payment processing
- Learn how to deploy and configure a full-stack application for production

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**

- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Framer Motion

**Backend:**

- Next.js API Routes / Serverless Functions
- PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM

**State Management:**

- Zustand
- React Query

**Additional Tools:**

- Uploadthing (image storage)
- Algolia (search)
- Stripe (payments)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asifazimi/sprout-scribble.git
   cd sprout-scribble
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration values (e.g., Algolia keys, Stripe keys, database URL).

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. For deployment, you can use platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

## What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with the modern web development stack. I now have a much deeper understanding of full-stack architecture, real-world application structure, performance optimization, and production deployment. It also taught me how to work with third-party tools like Algolia, Stripe, and image hosting services, which are common in industry-grade applications.
